### Purpose to Make Calculator

:ballot_box_with_check:A to-do app can be a great reminder or starting point when it comes to CRUD in web development. Being able to read information, create new information, update existing information, and delete information can be powerful in any application.

> Read a list of tasks.
> Add a task using the mouse or keyboard.
> Delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
> View a specific subset of tasks.
> View tasks based on categories.
> Able to create new categories.
